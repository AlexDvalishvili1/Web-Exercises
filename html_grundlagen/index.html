<p>Basic programming knowledge is becoming increasingly important as digitalization progresses. Software developers and
    people with solid programming skills are therefore more in demand than ever on the job market! In the existing
    training centers at universities, technical colleges and HTLs, not enough people are currently being trained to meet
    the increasing demand on the labor market. CODERS.BAY, as a cooperation between BFI and GRAND GARAGE, therefore
    offers an alternative for companies and private individuals - our program is aimed at people with and without
    experience in the area of ​​coding or network technology. In five months you will be trained to become a junior
    coder or network engineer. You decide for yourself in which environment you start your career.</p>
